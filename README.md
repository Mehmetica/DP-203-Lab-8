# DP-203-Lab-8
Azure Synapse Analytics - Lab 08: Exploring a Relational Data Warehouse
Project Overview
This project involves exploring a relational data warehouse using a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics. It is part of the Microsoft DP-203: Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure certification course. The focus of this lab was to understand how to work with relational data, create SQL queries, and implement performance optimization techniques in a cloud environment.

Learning Objectives
By completing this lab, the following skills were gained:

Creating and configuring dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse.

Querying relational data using SQL, including performing JOINs, aggregate functions, and window functions.

Exploring performance optimization methods, such as approximate count techniques.

Interpreting data warehouse structures and understanding the relationships between fact and dimension tables.

Technologies Used
Azure Synapse Analytics

Dedicated SQL Pools in Azure Synapse

SQL (Structured Query Language)

Steps Performed
Created a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics to work with the relational data warehouse.

Imported sample datasets and analyzed fact and dimension tables.

Created SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights from the data warehouse.

Optimized performance of the queries using techniques like approximate count.

Performed data exploration using complex SQL joins and aggregations.

Project Setup
Azure Subscription: Ensure you have an active Azure account with access to Azure Synapse Analytics.

SQL Client: Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Azure Data Studio to connect to your Synapse Analytics workspace.

Dedicated SQL Pool: Set up a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics for query execution.

Sample Data: Import the sample datasets provided in the course or use the datasets provided by Azure Synapse documentation.

How to Run Queries
Set up your dedicated SQL pool and ensure it's operational.

Import the necessary sample data for practice.

Use SQL queries to interact with the relational data in the Synapse workspace.

Refer to the specific sections in the lab instructions for queries you can try.
